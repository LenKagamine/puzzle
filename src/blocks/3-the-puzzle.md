The 15 Puzzle is the grid on the right. It consists of 15 square tiles numbered from 1 to 15, placed on a 4x4 grid, with one tile missing in the corner.

The puzzle also exists in various other sizes, such as the smaller 3x3 "8 Puzzle" and the larger 5x5 "25 Puzzle". In general, these sliding puzzles are collectively called the "n-puzzle" (also called the "$n^2-1$-puzzle"). This can be generalized even further to cover any rectangular pxq board sizes like a 3x4 "11 Puzzle".

Initially, the tiles in the board will be scrambled up, completely out of order. The goal is to slide the tiles into the blank to bring the board back to its solved state.

Finding a solution is easy and can be done by hand, but finding the shortest solution is rather difficult, even for computers. ([x] Finding the length of the shortest solution to an arbitrary board state is proven to be NP-hard.) However, various methods have been discovered to find the shortest solution faster and faster.
